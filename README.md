Palette is a tool for use with [TypographyKit](https://github.com/rwbutler/TypographyKit) which takes your app's color palette as defined in your TypographyKit.json or TypographyKit.plist file and generates a palette for use in Xcode Interface Builder so that developers can easily make use of the same colors regardless of whether they are being assigned programmatically or through IB.
